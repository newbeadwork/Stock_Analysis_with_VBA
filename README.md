Used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data in Excel for 2014-2016 as a homework assighnment for Data Analysis Bootcamp. 
(Note: because of a limited size of Github repo the Excel file (~100 MB) isn`t included)

1. Created VBA script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

     * The ticker symbol.

     * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

     * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

     * The total stock volume of the stock.

2. Used conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.

3. VBA script also is able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

4. VBA script runs on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
